Welcome to the official repository for **MultiConIR**, a novel benchmark specifically designed to evaluate retrieval and reranking models under multi-condition retrieval scenarios.

## Overview

MultiConIR (Multi-Condition Information Retrieval) is a comprehensive benchmark aimed at evaluating retrieval models in scenarios involving queries with multiple conditions. Unlike traditional single-condition retrieval tasks, MultiConIR reflects realistic and complex search scenarios across five domains:

- Books
- Movies
- People
- Medical Cases
- Legal Documents

## Features

MultiConIR focuses on three key evaluation aspects:

1. **Complexity Robustness**: How effectively retrieval models handle queries with increasing complexity (1 to 10 conditions).
2. **Relevance Monotonicity**: Assessing if models maintain consistent relevance ranking when conditions progressively increase.
3. **Query Format Sensitivity**: Evaluating the stability of retrieval performance across instruction-style and descriptive-style queries.

## Dataset Construction

MultiConIR utilizes a structured and rigorous pipeline for dataset creation:

1. **Condition Sentence Extraction**: Identifies ten key, non-redundant condition sentences from real-world documents using GPT-4o.
2. **Query Generation**: Creates instruction-style (structured) and descriptive-style (natural language) queries with incremental conditions from 1 to 10.
3. **Hard Negative Generation**: Produces semantically similar yet subtly distinct negative sentences to challenge retrieval systems.

## Benchmark Tasks

MultiConIR defines three comprehensive evaluation tasks:

- **Complexity Robustness**: Measures how retrieval performance is affected as the number of conditions in queries increases.
- **Relevance Monotonicity**: Evaluates modelsâ€™ ability to rank documents consistently based on the number of conditions matched.
- **Query Format Invariance**: Assesses model sensitivity to different query formulations (instruction-style vs descriptive-style).

## Performance Highlights

- **GritLM-7B** demonstrates the highest robustness against increased query complexity.
- **NV-Embed** shows exceptional adaptability to longer documents, maintaining performance stability better than other models.
- Reranking models outperform retrievers on simpler queries but experience significant performance drops as query complexity rises.
